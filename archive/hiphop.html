    <p style="font-family:arial">HHI IS TRULY UNITING THE WORLD OF HIP HOP THROUGH DANCE.
Founded in 2002 and based in Los Angeles, Hip Hop International is the producer of multiple live and televised street dance competitions that are the largest and most respected in the world. 
The idea for Hip Hop International began in 2000 when HHI cofounders Howard and Karen Schwartz saw street dancers in Paris and Tokyo captivating large crowds with incredible dance moves.  Because it was a style of entertainment that transcended language barriers, they saw the potential to reach an ever- wider audience from the beginning. 
In the United States, HHI properties include ABDC, Urban Moves Dance Workshops, USA Hip Hop Dance Championship, World Hip Hop Dance Championship and World Battles: Bboy, Popping, Locking, Whacking and All Styles.
