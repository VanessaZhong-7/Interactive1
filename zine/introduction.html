		<h2>Early life</h2>
		<p class="desc">
				Richard Brautigan was born in Tacoma, Washington. 
He had a difficult childhood, and he did not attend college. When he was in his 20s, he moved to San Francisco, California.
In 1938, Brautigan and his mother began living with a man named Arthur Martin Titland. 
Many of Brautigan's childhood experiences are included in the poems and stories that he wrote from as early as the age of 12. 
His novel So the Wind Won't Blow It All Away is loosely based on childhood experiences, including an incident in which Brautigan accidentally shot the brother of a close friend in the ear, injuring him only slightly.

		<h2>Career</h2>
		<p class="desc">
			In San Francisco, Brautigan sought to establish himself as a writer. 
He was known for handing out his poetry on the streets and performing at poetry clubs. 
In the 1970s Brautigan experimented with literary genres. He published five novels (the first of which, The Abortion: An Historical Romance 1966, had been written in the mid-1960s) and a collection of short stories, Revenge of the Lawn (1971).
Brautigan's writings are characterized by a remarkable and humorous imagination. 
The permeation of inventive metaphors lent even his prose works the feeling of poetry. </p>

		<h2>Personal life</h2>
		<p class="desc">
			Brautigan remarried on December 1, 1977, to the Japanese-born Akiko Yoshimura, whom he met in July 1976 while living in Tokyo. 
The couple settled in Pine Creek, Park County, Montana, for two years. Brautigan and Yoshimura divorced in 1980.
He had a relationship with a San Francisco woman named Marcia Clay from 1981 to 1982. 
He also pursued a brief relationship with Janice Meissner, a woman from the North Beach community of San Francisco. 
Brautigan was an alcoholic throughout his adult life and suffered years of despair; according to his daughter, he often mentioned suicide over a period of more than a decade before ending his life.

		<h2>Legacy</h2>
		<p class="desc">
			Because Brautigan frequently wrote in first-person and included locations and events with which he is associated, readers might assume his work is autobiographical. 
Writing in 1972, Long Island University professor Terrence Malley points out that "Brautigan's books are for the most part both directly autobiographical and curiously elusive.
It's usually difficult to separate confession from whimsy in Brautigan's writing.
